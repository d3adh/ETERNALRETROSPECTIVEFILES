<p class="borderexample">1/3/22, 7:37pm<br> New years hit and with it a wave of revulsion, anxiety, and agony. i dont want a repeat of 2021 or 2020, but i know itll go that way. i lack the courage and willpower to change my habits, worldview, and lifestyle. i potray myself as a strong, charismatic, and intelligent individual. in reality, i am as weak, gullible, and unknowledgable as a child. i have many wants and needs, none of which i am confident enough to achieve or deserving of. i may not have it as bad as other people, but its so hard to look past my emotions, past, whatever. i look at all of my friends, achieving things and being the intelligent, gifted individuals they are, like E, B, J, or S. all 4 of them have their own specific issues, but theyre so smart and such good people, i cant help but to be a little jealous of them. i know its a "grass is greener" kind of thing, but i have nothing to show for my suffering and effort. im too dumb to get anything as well. it feels like rng was stacked against me. i accidentally upset E and now shes being a little more reserved than usual, which is to be expected. noone wants to converse with an asshole, even if they dont intend to be an asshole. i hope this year i get the courage to actually fix myself or blow my brains out. this is hell.</p>

<p class="borderexample">12/30/21, 6:52pm<br>updated the site a bit. looks better, i think. at least now the journal is easier to read for other users. thats gotta count for something, right?<p>
<h3>━━━━━━━━</h3>
<p class="borderexample">12/29/21, 2:37am<br>you cant treat someone like shit, then claim its comedy and expect them to never get tired of it. thats not how it works.<br><br>12/29/21, 2:47am<br>is it me? somehow my fault? it probably is. it always is. i should be used to it by now.<br><br>12/29/21, 2:04pm<br>i cant tell if you hate me or not. maybe im just tired and need rest. i keep overthinking every little thing you say to me. its starting to be detrimental to my mental state, honestly. i need to learn to not overthink and just roll with the flow. but i rolled with the flow for so long that its agnozing to not be in control. christ, what a mess</p>
<h3>━━━━━━━━</h3>
<p class="borderexample">12/27/21<br>i can't get over it, no matter how hard i try. i cant believe someone would do that to someone so sweet. no means fucking no, but i guess some people cant fucking understand that. im so angry, at that fuckin' prick for his actions. im so angry at myself for my own inability to help j. i can tell jokes and be funny, but humor doesnt mask that sort of trauma. godfuckingdammit, i want to hurt someone. but i cant. i cant be of use if im in jail on a charge. ive gotta hold it together, if only for j's sake.

<p class="borderexample">12/26/12 - INTRO/FORWARD
<br>hello, user. if you are reading this, you have somehow stumbled upon my site and no doubt took notice of the "Journal" button. Fair warning, this is my entire life story almost. everything here is 100% true, but very, very distressing. readers beware.<br><br>i guess for context, i should start at the beginning, when i was born.<br><br>i was born to a 20 year old stripper/cocaine addict, my father was a former united states marine turned bullrider. they had met under circumstances i am unaware of, but i know that my conception was a mistake. an oversight, even. my mother and father had a rocky relationship, according to them. excessive drug use, alcohol abuse, constant arguing, the works. it was your typical young and dumb couple. however, my mother forced my father to abandon her and me when i was born, out of fear that his less than legal activities would catch up with him, and subsequently her and me. my mother instead married a wealthy family friend, who was double her age. he had his own mechanics business, which he worked in. this man was also an ex soldier. i guess my mom had a type.<br><br>Anyway. i was not told that the man she married was not my father. in fact, my mother and adopted father lied to me, convincing me that i was my adopted fathers offspring. there were clues of the truth, looking back into it, but being a child, i did not recognize them.<br><br>this man adopted me, treated me like his own, spoiled me even. my real father was in out of my life until i was around seven years of age. he would routinely give me gifts, such as a toy truck i cherished. according to my mother, my adopted father was not a good man. he had, for example, allegedly once shot a family friend with a .357 magnum revolver because he was convinced my mother was cheating on him. i have very little reason to believe this, for reasons that will be clear soon.<br><br>when i was 5 years of age, i learned that my adopted father had been diagnosed with stage 3 cancer in his lungs. his work in the military, his mechanic business, and his heavy smoking had all caught up with him, it seemed. he did chemotherapy for several years, despite being told that he had mere months to live. this was allegedly due to wanting to teach me that "quitting isnt an option in the face of responsibility". all i learned is that chemotherapy takes a hellish toll on the human body, but his original intent had gotten through. eventually, he went into remission. it seemed like the battle had been won, but this was merely a temporary reprieve as several months later, he was diagnosed with brain cancer as well as his original diagnoses of lung cancer. i remember that he had driven me to my mothers work at Hollywood Video (a dvd/video game rental place, akin to Blockbuster) and told me to be good. my mother allowed me to stay and my father left. little did i know, he was going to purchase alcohol and speak to a close friend about killing himself, which he had been talked out of.
keep this in mind for this close friend is very relevant later.<br><br>the reason i remember this so vividly is because that night, after my mom ended her shift and we traveled home, we had gone to see the latest Terminator film and the latest Transformers film at ta local drive in. theater. the entirety of the Terminator film, my adopted father was drinking Jack Daniels whiskey. by the end of the film and beginning of the Transformers film, he was so sloshed that he had no idea what was happening. we ended up going home and watching the movie when it came to dvd later on. this marks a turning point, as this is the last memory from this time period that i can look back on fondly.<br><br>this is because he had started dying after this. he began a "new" and "innovative" treatment known as Gamma Knife. this treatment turned out to be killing him faster than the cancer, all while almost not affecting the cancer at all. this proved to be too much for his body, and it was here his mind started to slip, shortly followed by his body. within a year, he was bed bound, almost totally unable to walk and his mind started confusing things, similar to a victim of dementia.<br><br>it was here that the mormon church, in 2009, entered my families lives. i was tending to the house, doing dishes and caring for my dying adopted father, when there was a knock on the door. it was two missionaries, whos names will not be revealed for privacy reasons. they helped me clean the house and listened to my woes and spoke with my adopted father. not once did they mention the church or anything. i was smitten with how kind they were and they promised to visit again. they did so, a week later when my mom was home. i had told her of what they had done, and was suspicious of their intent. when they came around and told her, my adopted father, and i about their church. we all felt a connection because of their kindness, so we collectively decided to attend one sundays worth of sermon, at the the combined efforts of the missionaries and my encouragement. it was a very...enlightening sermon and we became full fledged members of the church within mere months. the kindness of that ward was nearly unparalleled, even within their own church.<br><br>everal months after being baptized, my father passed. i only remember flashes of the funeral. i couldnt handle his death, and neither could my mother. she completely shut down and only sat on the porch of our trailer, in total shock. that friend i mentioned before eventually came around, looking to check up on us. my biological father had informed me this would happen as this friend would be raising me and helping my mother grieve, as my biological father had been absent for several years at this point. the family friend, who would later become my stepfather, would help my mother recover, caring for her in a way that i was unable. he would also go on to help me work through my own grieving a little. i was no longer angry about my adopted fathers death, i now knew that everyone and everything dies and i should be happy that he had lived for so long in the first place.<br><br>he also helped me work through my molestation, which occurred at the hands of my cousin. i will not be going into details as it is still a very distressing subject for me. however, this initial kindness would only serve to cause doubts within myself later on when i learned his true nature.<br><br>after these events took place, he convinced me and my mother to move to arkansas, his state of birth. my mother agreed, after months of deliberation and dicussion. when we moved, we ended up meeting his very eccentric and quite snobby family. they were rich and thought of anyone poorer than them as subhuman, as it were. i personally never cared for them, as anyone with eyes could see how...fake they were. however, they helped my family acquire property in arkansas, so a begrudging trust was in order.<br><br>It is here, in 2012, that my stepfather started being abusive towards me and my mother. he would regularly lash out at me, hit me with his hands and various objects, berating me with all manner of insults just because he felt like it. my mother definitely was also in a bad situation, but she found the abuse on me cathartic and even humorous. i remember on multiple occasions of my mother laughing and making fun of me as my father choking me, and slugging me in the stomach, which she claims to absolve herself of even though she admits this freely. i tried telling her, begging with her, that this couldnt go on, but she encouraged my stepfather. this culminated in 2013 when i attempted suicide via hanging. i had gotten so far as to actually be hanging when my stepfather saved my life. any rational person would expect this to mark a time of healing, a change in behavior and the beginning of mending the family. any rational person would be wrong, as the abuse only increased in intensity. i was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder immediately after being hospitalized, but this mattered not to my family. they saw it as weakness and sought to exploit it for their own amusement.<br><br>this would continue until 2014. at this point, we had moved to missouri for reasons that are insignificant in the big picture. it was then, i began to grow tired of my stepfathers antagonizations and would begin fighting back against him, which would more often than not result in my injury. it was during one of these scuffles that he would break my nose by slamming my head onto the pavement of our carpark. i decided right then was enough and told my mom that i need out of this situation by any means necessary. she contacted a childcare facility and within a month, i was pulled out of school and forced into the harsh world of the child care industry. i was shuffled through several facilities and even foster homes with a gamut of medications and therapists. these were almost useless as a full year and a half later, i was released back into nearly the same situation with my mother. the biggest change was that my mother and stepfather were now living in serperate housing arrangements as that was the only way i was allowed to return to my mothers care. this proved to actually be beneficial to our parental relationship, as we grew closer and even kind of reconciled. by the time i was in her care once more, it was 2016 and i had just celebrated my 16th birthday.<br><br>>all good things come to a close, as we were forced to move because my stepfather had acquired (and subsequently let loose) a number of untamed canines, which actually attacked a handful of people. understandably, the trailerpark we were living in took exception to this. we were once again in the same roof, though my stepfather had become relatively more tame, or rather more hesitant to cause any problems with me, though he would regularly yell at my mother and treat her poorly, which i eventually began calling him out on. i was tired of seeing him victimize my mother. however, my then girlfriend would almost always come to his defense, despite essentially living at our house. i thought this was odd, but it was explained several months after our breakup (which occured for unrelated reasons) when my mother confided in me that she had caught my stepfather cheating on her with my girlfriend. such is life, i guess. i'd be lying if i said i didnt have melancholic feelings about her still, but that ship is LONG sailed.<br><br>by 2019, we again ended up moving once more, with my stepfather becoming more and more argumentative, going so far as to force me out when i caught him abusing my border collie, collin. i had recently met a friend who lived in texas that offered me a place to go, so i saved up as much money as i could, quit my job, and made my way there with help from my mother by august 2020. i accidentally left my social security card and identification with my mother, so i had no way to reacquire either one, but i was sure this wouldnt be a problem. anyone who knows how these things work know that i would regret this. still regretting it, actually. american bureaucracy at its finest.<br><br>several months after i had properly integrated with my roommate and finally began exploring my own freedom and personality, i got a call from my mother. she told me that she had left my stepfather and that she had "met an old flame". i was taken aback as i had been sure that shed never leave that abusive shitsack she married all those years ago, but i was overjoyed at her freedom. that is, until she revealed the truth that this "old flame" was my actual biological father and that the man who had visited me and my adopted father several times and given me my prized toy truck as a child was my father. she essentially informed me that everything i had known, from the origin of my name, to the truth behind how she met my father was a lie. none of it was true. i had a full on psychological break after meeting my father via facebook messenger call, to which my roommate had the idea to buy two bottles of high proof rum and we could sit and drink. this wound up proving to be a bad idea because i simply slugged down as much of this Bumbu Rum as i could before i passed out, resulting in me having minor alcohol poisoning and a two thousand dollar hospital visit. he believed i was in a more sound state of mind, so he is not at fault. i should have had more control.<br><br>months pass and i get to know my father more and more, only to learn that my mom isnt the only women in his life, although she is the "most important" to him. i also learn that he does drugs, still. methamphetamine, specifically. he assures me that he is not addicted to it and i believe him out of naivety and wanting to build relations. this would be revealed very recently to now that he has been lying to me and using my confidence in his abilities to not be addicted to lie to my mom. on top of this, my mom has caught him cheating on her, with a woman half his age. these things drove me to have a minor breakdown with my schizoaffective disorder causing me to question everything ive learned and experienced for two full days.<br><br>things have been tough, and seem to only be getting...stranger. some days are better than others, but im hoping that using this website as a journal to vent will help me figure some things out. i may update it very sporadically, depending on events happening and things i decide to talk about.</p>
